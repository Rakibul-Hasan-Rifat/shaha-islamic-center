###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

#### Answer: A: {}

<i>
    Here are three lines of code. 
    - In the first line a variable is declared but not assigned any value. 
    - In the second line of code, we can observe a variable assigned an empty object but not defined with any keyword like `var`, `let` and `const`.
    - 3rd line is nothing but an output.
    <br/>
    In JS (JavaScript), there is no problem to assign value to an undeclared variable. So, the output will be an empty object (`{}`)

- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

#### Answer: C: "12"

<i>
    In javascript, there is a concept named 'type casting'. This concept means that JS (JavaScript) can internally change the types of the variable. So, here are two variables being added. One of them is number and another one is string. When string and number type variables are added, it behaves like 'concatenate'. That's why it will show the third option.

#### Answer: C: 3

<i>
    `forEach` function for 4 times because of having 4 items or values. First time, it will add nothing because of failing the condition. Then each time it will add 1 to the previous one. That's how it'll be 3 after the loop is finished.
